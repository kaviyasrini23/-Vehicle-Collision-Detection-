# -Vehicle-Collision-Detection-
Vehicle Collision Detection and Alert System using YOLO Algorithm
Overview
----> This project implements a real-time vehicle collision detection system leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The system detects collisions on roads and automatically sends alerts to authorities and emergency contacts, helping to reduce response times and enhance road safety.

Features
----> Real-time collision detection: Uses YOLO for accurate and fast object detection in live video streams.

----> Automated alert system: Sends instant notifications to authorities and emergency contacts upon detecting collisions.

----> Collision analysis: Provides details about the collision event to assist emergency response.

Tech Stack:
----> Python

----> OpenCV

----> YOLO Object Detection Algorithm

----> Machine Learning
